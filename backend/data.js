            description: 'Rudolf Steiner first proposed the idea of biodynamic farming to a group of concerned farmers back in 1924. His idea of treating the farm as a self-sufficient living entity still is as current as it was back then. I grew up in a similar background to the Steiner model, but not as concise as the philosophy of Steiner. I have strong feelings about these things. I lived for sometime with my mother in a commune; a short train ride from outside Copenhagen. There was no farming there, but the social aspect of multiple families living together in «harmony» was not far away from the ethos of Steiner.'
